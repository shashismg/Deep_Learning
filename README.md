# üß† Deep Learning Fundamentals ‚Äì CNN | RNN | LSTM | GRU

This repository contains my personal learning notebooks where I explored the basic concepts of deep learning model architectures ‚Äî **CNN**, **RNN**, **LSTM**, and **GRU**.

These notebooks are not exhaustive tutorials but a reflection of my journey into understanding how these foundational models work. I‚Äôve broken them down topic-wise to keep it modular and easy to follow.
